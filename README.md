## About this boilerplate

Laravel Localization Starter was created after my weekend research on translating entire applications, even the URL path.

Was added URL path translate support and optional `/<locale>` route preffix.

#### Example:

`http://website.com/example/123` points to WelcomeController@example for English.

`http://website.com/pt/exemplo/123` also points to WelcomeController@example for Portuguese.
